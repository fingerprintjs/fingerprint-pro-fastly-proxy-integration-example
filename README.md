# Fingerprint Pro Fastly Proxy Integration

[Fingerprint](https://fingerprint.com) is a device intelligence platform offering 99.5% accurate visitor identification.

Fingerprint Fastly Proxy Integration is responsible for proxying identification and agent-download requests between your website and Fingerprint through your Fastly infrastructure. The integration uses [Fastly Compute services](https://www.fastly.com/products/compute).

## ðŸš§ Requirements and expectations

* **Integration in Beta**: Please report any issues to our support team.

* **Limited to Enterprise plan**: The Fastly Proxy Integration is accessible and exclusively supported for customers on the **Enterprise** Plan. Other customers are encouraged to use [Custom subdomain setup](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/custom-subdomain-setup) or [Cloudflare Proxy Integration](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/cloudflare-integration).

* **Manual updates occasionally required**: The underlying data contract in the identification logic can change to keep up with browser updates. Using the Fastly Proxy Integration might require occasional manual updates on your side. Ignoring these updates will lead to lower accuracy or service disruption.

## How to install

This guide assumes you already have a [Fastly account](https://www.fastly.com/signup) and a [Fingerprint account](https://fingerprint.com/signup).

### 1. Create a Fingerprint Proxy Secret

1. Go to the Fingerprint [dashboard](https://dashboard.fingerprint.com/) and select your application.
2. Navigate to **App settings** > **API keys**.
3. Click **Create Proxy Key**.
4. Name the key `Fastly Integration`.
5. Click **Create API Key**.

You will use the secret to authenticate requests from your proxy integration to the Fingerprint API. 

### 2. Create a Fastly API token

1. [Create a Fastly API Token](https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/using-api-tokens#creating-api-tokens) in your Fastly dashboard. 
2. Make sure the token has `global` scope.
3. Name your token `Fingerprint`.
4. Note the value of your token somewhere. You will use it in the following step to deploy the proxy integration to your Fastly account.

### 3. Install and configure the Fastly CLI

1. Install the Fastly CLI on your computer following [Fastly documentation](https://developer.fastly.com/learning/compute/#install-the-fastly-cli).
2. Configure the CLI profile with the token you created in the previous step:
   
    ```
    fastly profile create
    ```

### 4. Clone this repository and prepare it for deployment

1. Run `git clone git@github.com:fingerprintjs/fingerprint-pro-fastly-proxy-integration.git`
2. Run `cd fingerprint-pro-fastly-proxy-integration`
3. Run `yarn install`
4. Inside the `fastly.toml` file, add your email to `authors` field. 

    ```diff
    - authors = []
    + authors = ["your.name@yourcompany.com"]
    ```

### 5. Deploy the service

1. Run `yarn deploy`.
2. Type `y` to create a new service.
3. You can keep `fingerprint-pro-fastly-proxy-integration` as the service name.
4. Skip through the rest of the prompts by pressing `Enter`.
  
Fastly will create the service under one of it's domains, `{host}.edgecompute.app`. We will change it later. 
At this point the service is still returning `{"error":"something went wrong"}` as it requires more configuration.

### 6. Configure service backends in Fastly

We will add two backends, `fpcdn.io` and `api.fpjs.io`. 

1. Go to your Fingerprint service in the [Fastly dashboard](https://manage.fastly.com/services/all) and select the latest editable version. If you don't have a editable version, click **Edit Configuration** and **Clone version N (active) to edit** to create an editable version of the service. 
2. Click **Origins** on the left menu.
3. Click **Create Host**, type `fpcdn.io` and click **Add**.
4. Click **Edit** on the previously created host.
    - Change its name to `fpcdn`.
    - Scroll down and set **Override host** to `fpcdn.io`.
    - Click **Update** to save changes.
6. Click **Create Host**, type `api.fpjs.io` and click **Add**.
7. Click **Edit**  on the previously created host.
   - Change its name to `fpjs`.
   - Scroll down and set **Override host** to `api.fpjs.io`.
   - Click **Update** to save changes.

> [!WARNING]
> If you are not using the Global/US [Fingerprint region](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/regions), instead of `api.fpjs.io` use `eu.api.fpjs.io` for the EU region or `ap.api.fpjs.io` for AP region.

### 7. Add a config store

1. In Fastly, go to the [Resources tab](https://manage.fastly.com/resources/config-stores).
2. Click **Create a config store**.
3. Name the config store *exactly* `Fingerprint` (the store name is hard-coded in the service implementation) and click **Add**. 
4. Click **Link to services** and select `fingerprint-pro-fastly-proxy-integration`.
5. Click **Next**, select the current (draft) version of your service and click **Link only**.
6. Click **Finish**.
7. Find your new config store and click **Key-value pairs** and add the following values:
   - set `AGENT_SCRIPT_DOWNLOAD_PATH` to your chosen agent download path. It should be something random to avoid ad blockers, for example `463n7-d0wnl04d`.
   - set `GET_RESULT_PATH` to your chosen identification result path. It should be something random to avoid ad blockers, for example `1d3n71f1c4710n-r35ul7`.
   - set `PROXY_SECRET` to the value of your Fingerprint proxy secret you created in Step 1.


### 8. Activate the service

1. Go to the Fingerprint service in [Fastly dashboard](https://manage.fastly.com/services/all) and select latest editable version.
2. Click **Activate** (if you see **Validating** instead, wait for it to complete).

Wait for a couple of minutes for activation. At this point the integration works should be functional on the Fastly-provided domain. Go to `https://{host}.edgecompute.app/status` to verify that you can see the integration's status page. 

### 9. Create a domain for the service

We reccommned to use a subdomain of your main website. If you want to use an apex domain, see the [Fastly documentation](https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/using-fastly-with-apex-domains).
Do not use `fingerprint`, `fpjs` and other fingerprint-related terms in the subdomain to avoid ad blockers. Use something random or generic, for example: `metrics.yourwebsite.com`.

1. Navigate to  [Fastly dashboard](https://manage.fastly.com/secure) > **Secure** > **Manage certificates**.
2. Click **Secure domain** or **Secure another domain**.
3. Select **Use certificates Fastly obtains for you**.
4. Enter your domain and click **Add**.
5. Configure Certification authority and TLS configuration according to your needs and click **Submit**.
6. Follow the instructions on screen to validate the ownership of the domain.
7. After the validation is done, find your domain in [the list of domains](https://manage.fastly.com/network/domains), click **view details** and see the CNAME record which is in the form of `{letter}.sni.global.fastly.net`. Create a CNAME record for your domain using this value via your DNS provider.

### Add the domain

2. Click `Domains` on the left menu.
3. Click **Create Domain**, type the domain you've previously created.
4. Click **Add** to save changes.



## How to use

Configure the Fingerprint client agent to make requests to your integration instead of the default Fingerprint APIs.

- Set endpoint to the path of your identification proxy endpoint, for example, `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/YOUR_IDENTIFICATION_PATH`.
- For browsers and web-based mobile applications, set the `scriptUrlPattern` to the path of your agent-download proxy endpoint, for example, `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/YOUR_AGENT_PATH?apiKey=<apiKey>&version=<version>&loaderVersion=<loaderVersion>`.
    - Keep the query parameters as displayed here, including `<` and `>`.
    - The CDN installation method pattern looks slightly different: `https://metrics.yourwebsite.com/YOUR_AGENT_PATH?apiKey=PUBLIC_API_KEY`, see the full code examples below.

```js
// Pro JS Agent (NPM)
import * as FingerprintJS from '@fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs-pro'

// Initialize the agent at application startup.
const fpPromise = FingerprintJS.load({
    apiKey: your-public-api-key,
    scriptUrlPattern: [
        'https://YOUR_DOMAIN/YOUR_AGENT_PATH?apiKey=<apiKey>&version=<version>&loaderVersion=<loaderVersion>',
        FingerprintJS.defaultScriptUrlPattern, // Fallback to default CDN in case of error
    ],
    endpoint: [
        'https://YOUR_DOMAIN/YOUR_IDENTIFICATION_PATH',
        FingerprintJS.defaultEndpoint // Fallback to default endpoint in case of error
    ],
});
```
```js
// Pro JS Agent (CDN)
const url = 'https://YOUR_DOMAIN/YOUR_AGENT_PATH?apiKey=your-public-api-key';
const fpPromise = import(url).then((FingerprintJS) =>
    FingerprintJS.load({
        endpoint: [
            'https://YOUR_DOMAIN/YOUR_IDENTIFICATION_PATH',
            FingerprintJS.defaultEndpoint, // Fallback to default endpoint in case of error
        ],
    })
);
```
