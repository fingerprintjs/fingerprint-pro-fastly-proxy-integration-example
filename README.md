# Fingerprint Pro Fastly Proxy Integration

[Fingerprint](https://fingerprint.com) is a device intelligence platform offering 99.5% accurate visitor identification.

Fingerprint Fastly Proxy Integration is responsible for proxying identification and agent-download requests between your website and Fingerprint through your Fastly infrastructure. The integration uses [Fastly Compute services](https://www.fastly.com/products/compute). The property rules template is available in this repository.

## ðŸš§ Requirements and expectations

* **Integration in Beta**: Please report any issues to our support team.

* **Limited to Enterprise plan**: The Fastly Proxy Integration is accessible and exclusively supported for customers on the **Enterprise** Plan. Other customers are encouraged to use [Custom subdomain setup](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/custom-subdomain-setup) or [Cloudflare Proxy Integration](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/cloudflare-integration).

* **Manual updates occasionally required**: The underlying data contract in the identification logic can change to keep up with browser updates. Using the Fastly Proxy Integration might require occasional manual updates on your side. Ignoring these updates will lead to lower accuracy or service disruption.
